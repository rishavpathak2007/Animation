        <p>Cottari Kanakaiya Nayudu pronunciation (help·info) (31 October 1895 – 14 November 1967), also known as CK,
          was the first captain of the Indian cricket team in Test matches.He played first-class cricket
          regularly till 1958, and returned for one last time in 1963 at the age of 68. In 1923, the ruler of Holkar
          invited him to Indore and made him a captain in his army, conferring on him the honour of a Colonel in
          Holkar's Army.</p>

        <p>Arthur Gilligan led the first MCC tour to India in the 1926–27 season. For the Hindus at Bombay Gymkhana,
          Nayudu hit 153 in 116 minutes with 11 sixes. One of the sixes, off Bob Wyatt, landed on the roof of the
          Gymkhana. The MCC presented him with a silver bat in recognition of that innings. He was also the first Indian
          cricketer to endorse a brand (Bathgate Liver Tonic) in 1941. The Government of India awarded him the third
          highest (then second highest) civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1956.
